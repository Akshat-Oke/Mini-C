# Mini-C
A compiler for a subset of C, made using lex and yacc.

## Language features
1. Type: int, float, char
2. Basic statements: expression statement, assignment statements, and compound statements, declaration statement.
3. Control and looping statements: if statement, for statement, while statement, and
switch statement. (note that nesting of these statements is also possible.)
4. System functions: printf and scanf statements.
5. Other: Variables, arrays, and function

The syntax for the above is same as in C language. The structure of the input program is also
same as a C program.
